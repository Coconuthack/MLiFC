    "Congratulations. You have been selected for the second round in the Bletchley application process. In this test, we ask you to complete two Python assignments. One asks for your general knowledge of the Python syntax. The other one asks for a bit of knowledge on numpy and vectors. Remember: **Using google is okay!**. We don't expect you to know everything by heart, we just want to make sure you can solve a problem _somehow_.\n",
